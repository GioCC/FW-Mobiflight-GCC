Dear Mr. MÃ¶bius,
I am an enthusiast who, needless to say, appreciates your great work with the Mobiflight suite;
I like to experiment around cockpit building and, even though I haven't developed such a clever and comprehensive solution as yours, I like to fiddle around in developing both hardware and software (which is also may day job BTW) to this purpose.

I see that, from time to time, the request for more digital I/Os - and specifically the compatibility with common I/O expansion modules - pops up in the forum; I would endorse such requirement, but I fully agree with the fact that it would take up valuable time of yours.

I had a look at your code, both for the Arduinos and the C# application, and I have thought of a possible solution (which aims to maintain compatibility with as little modifications as possible); I could take care of implementing at least the Arduino part, and later maybe also the C# program. For this latter one I have the requirements fairly clear, only it would take a little more study in order to be able to carry out the modifications myself and maybe commit to implementing them.
I have in mind an expansion that could modularly cover at least most common parts such as e.g. x165, x595, MCP23x17, TLC5926/DM13A/STP16C05 (all of which I would also be able to implement).

If you agree, I would like to explain my proposed solution in some more detail, so as to make sure that it suits the code structure as conceived, and maybe to have you expose some caveats. I would probably try to develop this solution for myself anyway, but if possible, I'd like for it to also become a contribution for everybody else. 

I'm really looking forward to hearing your comments or suggestions.

Best regards
