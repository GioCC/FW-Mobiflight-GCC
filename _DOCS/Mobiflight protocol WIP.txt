Mobiflight protocol (v2 based on v1.8)

Config commands

[cmd] = c.p1.p2. [...] .pN
[cfg] = [cmd]:[cmd]: [...] [cmd]:[cmd]:

Values of 'c' (command code) and args for config commands:
"1"   Button            pin.Name  
"2"   Encoder           pin1.pin2.Name
"3"   Output            pin.Name
"4"   LedSegment        pinData.pinCS.pinCLK.brightness.numModules.Name
"5"   Stepper           pin1.pin2.pin3.pin4.btnpin.Name
"6"   Servo             pin1.Name
"7"   LcdDisplayI2C     addr.cols.lines.Name
"8"   InputMtx          Row0.Col0.NRows.NCols.base
"9"   Input165          pinData.pinCS.pinCLK.base.numDevices
"10"  Output595         pinData.pinCS.pinCLK.base.numDevices
"11"  OutLEDDM13        pinData.pinCS.pinCLK.base.numDevices
"12"  OutLED5940        [not implemented yet]
"13"  InOutMCPS         pinDataIn.pinDataOut.pinCS.pinCLK.addr.base.numDevices
"14"  InOutMCP0         pinSDA.pinSCL.addr.base.numDevices

All args are ASCII integer numbers, except "Name"s which are alphanum.

Example:
2.8.11.MyEncoder:4.6.7.8.15.3.Displays:11.2.3.4.0.2

Starting from v2.0: 
- All names are (as of now) ignored.
- If a cmd is passed with more arguments than required, excess args are now ignored.
  Previously they were incorporated in the last one, which was tolerated if that 
  was a number (atoi() ignored them), but annoying if it was a name.
  This also means that a convenience name can be added as a last, dummy argument even 
  for (new) commands that require none.
