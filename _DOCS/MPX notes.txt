Mobiflight - Use of MPX boards ("ArdSimX-style")

MPX boards (based on 74HC4067) can be used to extend the number of connected peripherals.
Here a few points and notes about their usage, with reference to the architecture used in ArdSimX.

- On the multiple end of an MPX, any of these can be found:
  1a. Single DI lines
  1b. Single AI lines
  2.  Input lines from DI block peripherals (eg. HC165)
  3a. Driver (outward) lines to DO block peripherals (eg. HC595, DM13A)
  3b. Driver (outward) lines to display  peripherals (eg. MAX7219, TM1637)
  3c. Driver (outward) lines to PWM/Servo controller peripherals (eg. TLC5947)
  3d. Driver (outward) lines to stepper controller peripherals (eg. VID6606, VID6608)
  For obvious reasons, single DO lines cannot (in practice) be multiplexed.

  Here are comments for above points in regard to ArdSimX:
  1a. Common, standard use
  1b. Common, standard use
  2.  Apparently not used (probably because it's easier to use option 1a anyway)
  3a. Apparently not used; DM13A LED drivers, for instance, are not used under mpx (probably because there is abundance of direct pins)
  3b. Standard display connection. 
      Up to 16 displays on an MPX block.
      Unit types can be mixed (MAX7219, TM1637, HC595, DM13A supported).
      HC595's or DM13A's, if connected here, are managed as display units.
      See further below for notes on connections.
  3c. Common, standard use
  3d. Common, standard use
  
  ALL MPXs share common address lines (4 outs from Arduino). At any given moment, all mpxs are switched on the same channel.
  The common lines of single line MPXs (1a, 1b) go each to its own direct pin.
  Output blocks (#3b..3d) only have one driver line MPX'd; they share remaining lines on common (reserved) output lines.
